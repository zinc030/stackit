Members can play, pause, and resume watching as they want, anytime, anywhere, and change their plans anytime.\r\n\r\nA culture of experimentation and data-informed decision-making allows Netflix to continuously evolve and improve all aspects of the product, delivering more joy to existing members and attracting new members from around the globe. The nerve center of experimentation at Netflix is our internal Experimentation Platform, which provides flexible solutions for designing, launching, and analyzing experiments and archiving results – all at a massive scale.\r\n\r\nWe are looking to add a broadly experienced, frontend-focused senior software engineer to our team to continue to help us build great internal products for the design and analysis of experiments.\r\n\r\nFront-end engineering on this team has some unique aspects. As described here, one of our core product strategies is to cede control of the visual representation of many experiment results to data scientists and engineers who build bespoke reports that are executed and rendered by our systems. But we also support less code-and-stats savvy users, from designers to product managers to executives. How do we enable such a broad suite of users to safely navigate a complex product that is a mix of infrastructure built by our team and reports contributed by power users? How do we deliver and distinguish between UI experiences targeted at decision-making (which need strict statistical controls) and those geared at exploration (which require low latency)? Where do we cede control to users, and where do we need to remain opinionated?\r\n\r\nWe work on a broad and evolving tech stack to build software systems for processing large data sets, performing statistical analysis, and representing results in human consumable formats. Although this role is primarily frontend engineering, we are ideally looking for someone who can also contribute to additional aspects of our stack. Our frontend is built in JavaScript/TypeScript. Much of our backend systems and APIs, including the mechanism for user contributions, are in Python. We also partner closely with data and platform engineering teams.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou Are\r\n\r\n\r\n    Experienced building and maintaining medium to large single-page applications. We currently work with TypeScript, React, Node.js, CSS, etc., but adapting to changing technology is an important strength.\r\n    Experienced with or have been exposed to some combination of data science workflows, data engineering, backend development in Python, API development, or data visualization.\r\n    A self-motivated engineer who thrives on direct and regular contact with our users and believes that fast user feedback and iteration results in better products.\r\n    Passionate about building high-impact, performant user experiences for platform tools with a highly technical user base, with a knack for simplifying user flows through complex systems\r\n    Independent, proactive, and able to deliver high-quality code that solves ambiguous user needs with minimal guidance. You unblock yourself as needed\r\n    Self-motivated and enjoy a variety of interdisciplinary collaboration models – from leading projects to jumping in at the last minute to get a project over the line. Our experimentation platform team brings together front and back end engineering, data science, design, and product management, and we aim to be much more than the sum of these parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nCulture\r\n\r\nNetflix offers amazing colleagues and a rapid pace of innovation. We embrace diversity and inclusion, and we are always on the lookout for stunning colleagues who bring new perspectives. Our unique culture emphasizes Freedom & Responsibility and permeates our way of work - hopefully, it resonates with you as much as it does with us.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore About Experimentation At Netflix\r\n\r\nCurious to learn more? Read up on experimentation culture at Netflix.\r\n\r\nAt Netflix, we carefully consider a wide range of compensation factors to determine your personal top of market. We rely on market indicators to determine compensation and consider your specific job, skills, and experience to get it right.
